# ROKY_V

## Introduction
This system is part of a larger systme I worked on while in National accounts. it takes a financial data set as input and create the output for National Accounts RokyV output. The script is developed using Apache spark (PySpark)

## Why?
As part of an effort to proceduralise the use of comersial data ources, and impooov the input to the national acounst systems.

## Status
System has fullfilled its primary goal, but smaler additions might be added in due time.
A script version will be added shortly for use in non notebook enviroments.

# How to use
* Give filepath to data set.
* give file path to where you want the output.
* Asign the variables to corresponding colum names.
* Run entire script, and output will be generated.
